                    <h2>Project Mixr</h2>
                    <p>A project for the Software Developer Methods and Tools class I took. I worked with 5 other group members to develop a website and database that allows users to create and upload drink recipes. I specifically worked as the Scrum Master, created the uppload drinks page, and created the database integration for uploading and fetching drinks. The project, as well as some more details about how it worked, can be found <a href="https://github.com/GlitchedChar/mixr-public">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>This website was initially created as my midterm project for the Web class that I took. I have then taken it and added more functionality to make it more accessible and eye-catching. The Github repository for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/JackGentleman/jackgentleman.github.io">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Tracklifts</h2>
                    <p>This was a project where I worked with 2 other students to design an app and then create a detailed wiremap prototype for it. This was a project for the Human Computer Interaction class that I took. The app we designed was a workout tracking app. The wiremap for it can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/d4e0MbxiQKQ5rXcHZpZcqG/Project-1---Interactive-Prototype---Revised?node-id=0%3A1">here</a> and the prototype based off of the wiremap can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/d4e0MbxiQKQ5rXcHZpZcqG/Project-1---Interactive-Prototype---Revised?node-id=6%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Danny R's Premium Beard Cream</h2>
                    <p>This was my final project for my Text class. I designed the logo and packaging for a fictional beard cream that I created based off of my professor, Danny Rankin. The design document, which include brainstorming materials as well as the final designs and mock-ups can be found <a href="img/374c06_6c78d8ac2efa4d2c87a2121bf4a2ccf4.pdf">here</a>.</p>
