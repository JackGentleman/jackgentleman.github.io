                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Jack Gentleman. I am an Evans Scholar and senior at the University of Colorado Boulder where I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Creative Technology Design. I am originally from Clarendon Hills, Illinois. If I'm not programming or doing homework you can usually find me at the gym, bouldering in the Flatirons, playing video games, or playing guitar in a random corner. I love to read, my favorite is the Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. Music is also a big part of my life, I go to concerts often. My favorite band is Haken.</p>
